# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation of the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** because it ensures that the final product aligns with user needs and business goals.

During requirement analysis, stakeholders such as clients, end-users, and the development team collaborate to clearly define what the system should do, how it should behave, and what constraints it must operate under. This process helps bridge the gap between abstract business ideas and actionable technical solutions.

### Key Aspects of Requirement Analysis
- **Requirement Gathering:** Engage with stakeholders to collect initial requirements using techniques such as interviews, surveys, and workshops.  
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Refine and elaborate on the gathered requirements through brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping.  
- **Requirement Documentation:** Record the requirements in a detailed and structured format using specification documents, user stories, and use cases.  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Analyze and prioritize requirements, and create models to visualize and understand them better.  
- **Requirement Validation:** Review and validate requirements with stakeholders by defining acceptance criteria and ensuring traceability.  

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a critical step in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation for the entire project. Without a clear understanding of requirements, development efforts risk misalignment, delays, and increased costs. Below are three key reasons why it is so important:

1. **Prevents Miscommunication and Misunderstanding**  
   Requirement analysis ensures that both stakeholders and developers have a shared understanding of what needs to be built. This reduces ambiguity and minimizes the risk of delivering a product that doesn’t meet user expectations.  

2. **Saves Time and Reduces Costs**  
   Identifying and resolving issues during the requirement stage is much more cost-effective than fixing them later in design, development, or testing. Clear requirements streamline the development process and prevent unnecessary rework.  

3. **Supports Quality and Testability**  
   Well-defined requirements serve as the basis for designing effective test cases. This ensures that the final product can be validated against stakeholder needs and business objectives, ultimately improving software quality.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities to ensure that the software product being developed aligns with stakeholder needs and business goals. The five key activities are:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting raw information from stakeholders, users, and other sources about what the system should achieve. This forms the initial pool of requirements for further processing.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Using techniques such as interviews, questionnaires, workshops, and observations to uncover detailed requirements. This step goes deeper into understanding user expectations and system needs.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Organizing and recording requirements in a structured format, often as a **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)**. Clear documentation ensures consistency and serves as a reference throughout the SDLC.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Examining and refining the gathered requirements to resolve conflicts, remove ambiguities, and assess feasibility. This stage may include creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, use cases) to represent requirements visually.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Confirming that the documented requirements are accurate, complete, feasible, and testable. Validation involves stakeholders reviewing requirements to ensure alignment with business objectives before development begins.

These activities collectively ensure that the project starts with a solid foundation, reducing risks and increasing the chances of delivering a successful product.

## Types of Requirements

In software engineering, requirements are generally divided into two categories: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**.  
Using the **Booking Management Project** (similar to how applications like Airbnb, Booking.com, and OYO operate) as an example, here’s how these requirements can be defined:

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements describe **what the system should do** — the specific features, operations, and behaviors of the application.  

Examples for the Booking Management Project:
- **Hotel Management Service**
  - Allow hotel managers to add, update, and delete hotel details such as rooms, pricing, and availability.  
  - Provide a portal for managers to view booking details and manage customer reservations.  
- **Customer Service (Search + Booking)**
  - Allow customers to search for hotels based on filters (location, price, amenities, etc.).  
  - Enable customers to book a hotel room and complete payment through third-party payment services.  
  - Send notifications to managers when a customer books a room.  
- **View Booking Service**
  - Allow both customers and managers to view past and upcoming bookings.  
  - Provide customers with booking confirmation and cancellation options.  

---

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define **how the system should perform** — the quality attributes, constraints, and performance measures.  

Examples for the Booking Management Project:
- **Performance and Scalability**
  - The system should handle a high amount of concurrent user traffic without performance degradation (e.g., millions of daily users like Airbnb or Booking.com).  
  - Use caching systems like Redis and databases like Cassandra to ensure fast responses and efficient data handling.  
- **Reliability and Availability**
  - The system should provide 24/7 availability, ensuring that booking and hotel management services are always accessible.  
  - Implement master-slave database architecture to handle read/write operations efficiently.  
- **Security**
  - Protect user data during payments by integrating secure third-party payment gateways.  
  - Ensure secure authentication for hotel managers and customers to prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Maintainability**
  - Use microservice architecture to divide the system into smaller, manageable services for hotel management, booking, and viewing.  
  - Enable easier debugging, scaling, and deployment of individual services.  
- **User Experience**
  - Provide a smooth and glitch-free flow from hotel listing to booking and payments.  
  - Use CDN (Content Delivery Network) for faster content delivery, ensuring minimal loading time for customers worldwide.
